# FrogPrototype
Mechanics Prototype of the Frog Game for class

move around with the arrow keys or WASD
Camera moves with the mouse.
You can grapple with the left mouse button. Problem is the mouse is centered and locked. Only real way to have camera work properly. Will try to implement an auto target at a later date.
Wall walking does not work at the moment and is not implemented in this version.
