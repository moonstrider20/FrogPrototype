# FrogPrototype
Mechanics Prototype of the Frog Game for class

move around with the arrow keys or WASD
Camera moves with the mouse.
You can grapple with the left mouse button. You need to hold to continue grapple once started. When button is released the grapple stops. You need to aim with the mouse but problem is the mouse is centered and locked. Only real way to have camera work properly. At the moment you need to move the center of the screen to the point of where you want to grapple. The Grapple itself does work. Will try to implement an auto target at a later date.
Also character spins after a grapple. 
Wall walking does not work at the moment and is not implemented in this version.
